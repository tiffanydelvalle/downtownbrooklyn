<p>Downtown Brooklyn responds to Mayor Eric Adams’ proposed $40 million plan to improve the neighborhood. The plan promises street safety, improved public space, and is an initiative in collaboration with New York City Department of Parks and Recreation Commissioner Sue Donoghue and Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Specifically, there will be a streetscape improvement project along Fulton Street which should be adding trees and outdoor furniture such as benches and tables. The investment is supposed to revitalize one of Brooklyn’s largest economic hubs which includes Fulton Mall, City Point, Dekalb Market, and other local businesses. The beautification project will continue to encourage more consumers and shoppers from across the borough to visit and get their commercial and shopping needs addressed. The business district encompasses an array of different business types that will benefit from additional foot traffic in the neighborhood.</p>
